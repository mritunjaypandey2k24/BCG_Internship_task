# Financial Chatbot

This project implements a simple chatbot prototype that provides responses to predefined financial queries based on analyzed data from 10-K filings. The chatbot is designed in Python and can be run in a command-line interface.

## Features

- Responds to predefined financial queries, including:
  - Total revenue for a company in a specific year
  - Net income change over two years for a company
  - Total asset value for a company in a specific year
  - Total liability value for a company in a specific year
  - Cash flow from operating activities for a company in a specific year

- Data-driven responses based on analyzed financial data from 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.
  
## Limitations
The chatbot is limited to predefined queries and specific companies (Microsoft, Tesla, Apple) and years (2021-2023) based on available data.
No support for natural language processing or arbitrary queries beyond predefined formats.

## Future Improvements
 - Enhance with natural language processing for more flexible query handling.
 - Integrate dynamic data fetching for real-time financial information.
 - Expand the dataset to include more companies, industries, and financial metrics.
