    "## Chatbot Prototype Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This document outlines the design, features, functionality, limitations, and potential improvements of a chatbot prototype created to respond to predefined financial queries based on analyzed data from 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. The prototype is implemented using Python and operates via a command-line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predefined Queries\n",
    "The chatbot can respond to the following predefined financial queries:\n",
    "- \"What is the total revenue for [company] in [year]?\"\n",
    "- \"How has the net income changed for [company] from [year] to [year]?\"\n",
    "- \"What is the total asset value for [company] in [year]?\"\n",
    "- \"What is the total liability value for [company] in [year]?\"\n",
    "- \"What is the cash flow from operating activities for [company] in [year]?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data-driven Responses\n",
    "Responses are generated based on the financial data extracted and analyzed from 10-K filings. The chatbot provides specific numerical values or percentage changes for the requested financial metric and company/year combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User-friendly Interface\n",
    "The chatbot operates in a command-line interface, allowing users to input queries and receive corresponding responses. Clear instructions are provided for the expected query format to facilitate user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling\n",
    "If the user inputs a query that is not predefined, the chatbot responds politely indicating its capability to only provide information on predefined queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predefined Query Set\n",
    "The chatbot is limited to a specific set of predefined queries and cannot understand arbitrary financial questions or follow-up inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static Data\n",
    "Responses are based on static financial data extracted from the last three fiscal years' 10-K filings, lacking real-time data access or analysis capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Company and Year Constraints\n",
    "The chatbot is restricted to providing information for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple within the specified fiscal years available in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "The chatbot does not employ NLP techniques, relying solely on exact matches of predefined query formats for responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "Integrating NLP techniques would enable the chatbot to understand and respond to more conversational and varied queries, enhancing user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Data Integration\n",
    "Implementing mechanisms to fetch and analyze real-time financial data would keep the chatbot relevant and up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "Utilizing ML algorithms could enhance response accuracy and enable the chatbot to learn and adapt based on interactions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-modal Interaction\n",
    "Supporting multi-modal interaction (e.g., voice input/output) would improve accessibility and user-friendliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expanded Knowledge Base\n",
    "Enriching the chatbot's knowledge base with data from a broader range of companies, industries, and financial metrics would enhance its usefulness and versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation provides insights into the current capabilities and areas for future development of the chatbot prototype, serving as a foundation for further enhancements and iterations. Each section details key aspects of the chatbot's design and functionality, along with potential strategies for advancing its capabilities to deliver more intelligent and comprehensive financial analysis services."
